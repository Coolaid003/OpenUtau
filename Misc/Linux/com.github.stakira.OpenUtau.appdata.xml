      Scope
      OpenUtau includes:

        A modern user experience.
        Selected compatibility with UTAU technologies.
        OpenUtau aims to solve problems in less laborious ways, so don't expect it to replicate exact UTAU features.
        Extensible realtime phonetics (VCV, CVVC, Arpasing) intellegence.
        English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian and more.
        Internationalization, including UI translation and file system encoding support.
        Smooth preview/rendering experience.
        A easy to use plugin system.
        An efficient resampling engine interface.
        Compatible with most UTAU resamplers.

      OpenUtau does not include:

        Full feature digital music workstation.
        OpenUtau does not strike for Vocaloid compatibility, other than limited features.
